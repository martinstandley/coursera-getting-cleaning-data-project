This data was develloped as a student assignment terminating the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

See https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project for more information.

## Input data

I fetched the input data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The input data was the result of experiments to collect acceleration and angular velocity (in 3 dimensions)
data from 30 volunteers whilst performing 6 specified movements. The data had been collected using a a Samsung Galaxy 
S Smartphone and then analysed and matched to the movements as recorded on video. The analysis produced 10299 observations 
with 561 variables but in the input data the observations were divided into a trainning set (7352 observations) and a 
test set (2947 observations). Labelling information for observation values, subject id and activity type was specified in
separate data sets.

See http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones for more information on data collection.

The full description of the input data files is appended to this file below.

## Project objective

The goal for this project was to tidy the data and then produce a data set containing the average values for those
of the observations based on the mean or standard deviation of measured values. The averaging should be done on 
grouping of obeservations per subject and activity.

## Output data
The output data set is "means-by-group.txt" which is table of averages of
the values of the variables whose names contained "means()" or "std()" grouped by subject and by activity.

The 79 variables that are averaged are:

## Treatment

The script for this project is in file run_analysis.R. The script performs the following tasks:
- Reads in the following files into data.frames with similar names:
    -   features (i.e. variable names) and activity.labels (names for activity numbers)
    -   X.test (observations), y.test (activity numbers) and subject.test (subject numbers)
    -   X.train (observations), y.train (activity numbers) and subject.train (subject numbers) 
-  Joins the 3 test and training data sets (observations, subjects and activities)
-  Gets the (79) column indeces and names for the variables whose names contain mean() og std() 
-  Extracts those columns from the combined data set.
-  Renames the columns with names from features 
-  Binds in 2 new columns to the observations for subject and activity
-  Then does a merge with activity labels to fetch in activity names
-  Fnally the data set is grouped by subject and activity and means calculated for each column
-  The resulting data is written to "means-by-group.txt"

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
